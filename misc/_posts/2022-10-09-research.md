### Recommendation system 

Recommendation systems are computer programs that provide personalized recommendations to users. They analyze users' past behavior to understand their preferences and interests, and then recommend various products, services, or content to them accordingly.

* Recommendation algorithms: This is the core technology of recommendation systems. Researchers develop algorithms that analyze users' past behavior data to provide personalized recommendations.

* User experience: Researchers study user experience to improve the quality of recommendations. This includes factors such as transparency, diversity, and trustworthiness.

* Use of recommendation systems: Researchers study how users interact with recommendation systems. For example, how recommendation systems may influence users' preferences or purchasing behavior.

* Application areas: Recommendation systems are applied in various fields, such as music, movies, books, shopping, and travel. Researchers study how recommendation systems can be tailored to specific application areas.
