<h4><span class="badge badge-info">Abstract</span></h4>
The distributed renewable energy resources (DERS) such as solar and wind energy have emerged in the last decade as a sustainable energy source. Since the small scale and dispersibility of DERs make it difficult to ensure a stable energy supply, they are managed as a group called virtual energy plants (VPP). However, the uncertainty in the existing energy prediction of DERs undermines the trust of VPPs, reducing the scale of the renewable energy market. To improve the prediction accuracy, we propose a trust-aware adjustment method for DERs. We first define the reliability of the DERs as a quantitative indicator and propose a prediction adjustment method based on the reliability. The experiment on the real-world dataset shows the proposed method outperforms the existing prediction methods in terms of non-trust hit rates.
