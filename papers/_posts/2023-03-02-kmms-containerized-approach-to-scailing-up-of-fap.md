<h4><span class="badge badge-info">Abstract</span></h4>
The deterioration of air quality stems from air pollutants emitted by industrial sectors. Government agencies in many countries regulate the total amount of emissions released during production, necessitating a continuous monitoring system to measure specific air pollutants. However, the existing systems are tailored to a specific plant, making it difficult to incorporate sophisticated components like streaming data processing engines. To address this issue, we propose a containerized approach that bundles rich components for continuous emission monitoring and enables rapid deployments in a new plant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using datasets obtained from real-world factory production.
