I have joined the Department of Computer Engineering·Artificial Intelligence at the [Dong-A University](https://english.donga.ac.kr/english/Main.do) since March 2022. And since January 2022, I have been conducting big data analysis and semantic annotation research in the [data science lab(DSL)](https://www.datasciencelabs.org).

The main research of interest are big data processing design and natural language analysis, and in my spare time, I enjoy traveling around various worlds while reading novels. Currently, I am conducting research because I am interested in developing efficient LLM use using natural language and knowledge graphs.

Master's thesis: Knowledge Graph-Empowered Annotation of Web Tables using Large Language Model
