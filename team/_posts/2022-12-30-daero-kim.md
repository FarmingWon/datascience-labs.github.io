I joined the Department of Computer Engineering at [Dong-A University](https://english.donga.ac.kr/sites/english/index.do) in March 2018. Since September 2022, I have been actively involved in the [Data Science Research Lab](https://www.datasciencelabs.org/), focusing on research related to site selection methodologies using data mining and graph networks. I'm currently working on a deep learning model scheduling system to reduce carbon emissions.
