Hello, I'm Bumku Choi, and I always make sure to complete the tasks assigned to me.  
I am currently studying graph-based recommendation systems using Python and striving to harness the power of graphs for various purposes.  
I enjoy working on projects with a team, as I find great satisfaction in collaborating with team members, communicating, and planning together. I have experience combining my own technical knowledge with that of my teammates.  
I have a keen interest in IT-related information and enjoy exploring various fields such as computers, mobile technology, artificial intelligence, and natural sciences. As a hobby, I also love swimming.
